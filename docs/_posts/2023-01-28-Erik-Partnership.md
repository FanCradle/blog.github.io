Erik is a Brazilian composer and producer born in Rip de Janeiro.
His musical upbringing was influenced by the myriad styles of his native Brasil as well as pop, rock and jazz.

Music was a passion since his childhood but it was not until his teens that he picked up a guitar for the first time falling in love with a new world he was entering.

In his early twenties he discovered electronic music through the wave of trip hop and electronics-infused rock that swept the world in the 90s.

His musical practice has also given him the opportunity to work with visual artists in performance, video, as well as theatre.

‘All That's Solid’ wastes no time drawing listeners in; it begins with a mysterious vibe. The opening track entitled ‘THE BEGINNING’ documents a desirable love that became too addictive and toxic. The struggling heartbeat towards the end of the track -  represents how painful and damaging toxic love can be.
